# Echo-Server
The server will take one line from the client each time. The first character of the 
line is ‘A’, ‘C’, or ‘D’ the rest of the line will be a set of letters that would be 
treated as one string.
o The server then receives your request then orders the characters of your string and 
sends the ordered string back to the client.
o If the first character is ‘A’ then the order will be ascending. If the first character is 
‘C’ the order will be preserved but all letters will be capitalized. However, if the 
first character is ‘D’ the order will be descending. Else, the server will return the 
same message it receives.
